MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. 

This repository contains codes to send data from raspberry pi to ESP8266, recieve data from ESP8266 onto raspberry pi, Send data from ESP8266 to raspberry pi, receive data from raspberry pi onto ESP8266 and send/recieve data from raspberry pi and node/send/recieve data from esp8266.

The user need to install a broker onto the system, here I have installed it on my raspberru pi.Many open source broker are available like Mosquitto, Mocha and also licensed broker like HIVEMQ and VERNEMQ are also available.
